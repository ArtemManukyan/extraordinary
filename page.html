				<h1>All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved.</h1>
				<div class="description">With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.</div>
				<div class="news-itself">
					<p>Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely 
					superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable 
					as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since 
					there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming 
					to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but 
					Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.</p>

							Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-line
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you 
					would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty 
					yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so 
					that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, 
					the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred 
					fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, 
					not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round, 
					cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of concentric 
					spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or minute vertical tube
					formed at the axis of the cheese.</p>
					<p>Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set all the 
					paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab 
					heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a 
					hideous motion. The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp 
					slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of 
					ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more 
					pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient 
					to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity 
					too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be 
					subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no 
					means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it may give 
					it compactness and gloss.</p>
					<p>Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-
					splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and 
					hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This 
					arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order 
					to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, 
					in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off 
					the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the 
					whale of courseis shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to 
					the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. 
					Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake.
					As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take 
					somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in 
					stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire 
					morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it 
					downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to 
					free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.</p>
